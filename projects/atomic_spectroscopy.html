<h3 class="major">Abstract</h3>

<p>This study analyzes and attempts to validate accepted theory regarding atomic spectroscopy. The methods conducted use two spectroscopy
    tools to record the emission spectrum of hydrogen: a manual contraption
    that relies on the naked eye via wave diffraction, and an electronic sensor that outputs numerical emission data. Data
    collected in both methods suggest a linear relationship between \( 1/\lambda \) and \( 1/\text{n}^2 \)
    which agrees with theory. However, data collected via the manual spectrometer did not agree with the accepted value of \( R \) due to a
    small dataset size and low precision. Our experimental value using
    the electronic spectrometer was \( R=10960000 \pm 38000 \) with respect to a 95
    percent confidence interval, which agrees with the accepted value. This
    study qualitatively compares the emission spectra of various atomic
    and bonded sources. We find that the bonded sources contain more complex and complete spectra compared to atomic sources. Finally, this study
    analyzes the emission spectra of indium phosphide quantum dots with
    various radii. We find a linear relationship between \( 1/\lambda \) and \( 1/\text{r}^2 \) as theory
    suggests. Our estimated values for the effective mass of an electron and
    the band gap energy, \( \text{m} = (0.0612±.012)\text{m}_\text{e} \) and \( \text{E}_\text{gap} = 1.265\text{eV} ±.15\text{eV} \)
    respectively, agreed with accepted values. Atomic spectroscopy theory is
    the foundation of many applications across various fields, heightening the
    importance of understanding and validating it.</p>

<h3 class="major">Introduction</h3>

<p>
Spectroscopy is a method scientists use to study the light emitted by matter.
Since everything we observe on a daily basis is comprised of matter, spectroscopy
has a wide range of applications in cosmology, chemistry, biology, medicine, engineering, and other fields. Scientists have taken advantage of the fact that
every element in our universe, when supplied with a particular amount of energy, emits photons at various energies across the electromagnetic spectrum.
The various energies of emitted photons, however, are unique to each element.
Therefore, it is possible for scientists to piece together the elemental constituents
of a chemical compound simply by analyzing the energies of photons released
by it. The energies of released photons have distinct wavelengths according to
the relation

\[ \text{E}_{\text{photon}}=\frac{hc}{\lambda} \]

where \( h \) is Planck’s constant and \( c \) is the speed of light.

Therefore, each element emits photons of distinct wavelengths. In order
to quantitatively measure the wavelengths emitted, light
diffraction can be used to separate emitted photon wavelengths from the source.
A diffraction grating works by allowing incident plane waves from the source
to pass through very narrowly spaced slits. This causes constructive
and destructive interference at various angles (Fig. 1). Points of constructive
interference occur at peaks at an angular displacement \( \theta \) governed by the equation

\[ d \sin{\theta} = m \lambda \]

where \( d \) is the distance between slits in the grating and \( m \) is the diffraction
order. The diffraction order can be any integer in a finite integer set centered
at zero. By measuring the angle \( \theta \) of diffracted light at the constructively
interfering peaks, Eq. 2 can be used to calculate the peak wavelengths \( \lambda \) of
diffraction.
</p>

<p>
    The emission of photons from a source is primarily due to electrons changing
energy levels within its constituent atom. More specifically, when an electron
absorbs the right amount of energy from its environment, it can jump to a higher energy level.
In this case, the electron is in its excited state. Eventually, the electron de-excited and falls back to a lower
energy level. As a result of de-excitation, the electron releases a photon of equal energy to the difference
between the initial electron energy level and its final energy level. Take the hydrogen atom 
which has one electron. Its emission spectrum can be modelled by Balmer’s formula

\[ \frac{1}{\lambda} = R \left( \frac{1}{n^2_{\text{final}}} - \frac{1}{n^2_{\text{initial}}} \right) \]

where \( R \) is a constant with accepted value \( 10973731.568549 \pm 0.000083 \text{ m}^{−1} \),
\( n_{\text{initial}} \) is the electron energy level after excitation, and \( n_{\text{final}} \)
is the electron energy level after de-excitation. Thus we can see that when \( n_{\text{final}}=2 \)
the peak wavelengths of the hydrogen emission spectrum are in the visible wavelengths.
</p>


<p>
    An important application of spectra comes in analyzing
quantum dots. Quantum dots are essentially artificial atoms, each of which
are comprised of a cluster of atoms of a semiconductor which release photons
at prescribed energies. The clusters are of nanometer-scale and small
enough to allow an electron to be bound to it. This electron is very strongly
bound to the dot such that it is not permitted to move freely. An electron
in this state is known to be in the valence band. If this electron absorbs a
particular amount of energy from its environment, it can transition to a higher
quantum state called the conduction band, where the electron is permitted
to move throughout the dot. The difference in energy of the electron between the valence band and the
conduction band is the band gap energy, \( \text{E}_{\text{gap}} \), which depends on the
chemical structure of the quantum dot. For the electron to transition to the
conduction band, it must, at a minimum, be provided
with energy equal to the band gap energy plus the kinetic energy corresponding
to the lowest energy state of the conduction band. The lowest energy state of
the conduction band is dependent on the radius of the quantum dot. Therefore,
the total energy required to transition an electron from the valence band to the
conduction band is:

\[ \text{E}_{\text{total}} = \text{E}_{\text{gap}} + \text{E}_{\text{kinetic}} = \text{E}_{\text{gap}} + \frac{h^{2}}{8\text{m}r^{2}}\]

where \( \text{m} \) is the effective mass of the electron (which can vary from its mass in
a vacuum), and \( r \) the radius of the quantum dot. Once an excited electron in the conduction band falls back into the valence
band, it releases a photon of energy \( \text{E}_{\text{total}}\). It is important to note that there
exists other energy states of the conduction band with higher kinetic energies.
However, the difference in these energies are relatively small compared to the
magnitude of the lowest state kinetic energy, so this does not result in a noticeable difference in energy of the emitted photon. 

This study first explores and analyzes the emission
spectrum of hydrogen using two different spectrometers. Then, the
emission spectra of atomic sources are compared to those of chemical compounds. Finally, the emission spectra of indium phosphide quantum dots are
 analyzed with special attention to the relation between photon energy emission and quantum dot radius.

<h3 class="major">Methods</h3>

<p>
A laboratory desk was used with an aluminum breadboard for mounting apparatuses. Two different spectrometers were used to collect emission spectra from
specimens. The first was a Griffin spectrometer which uses angular displacements of light ray diffraction to separate and measure wavelengths from a source
(Fig. 3a). Light from the source enters via a slit in the first cylinder which acts
as a collimating telescope. The entry slit width can be adjusted via a knob on
the instrument. The light waves pass the first cylinder and enter a diffraction
grating. The Griffin spectrometer uses a diffraction grating with slit spacing
\( 1.67 \times 10^{−6} \text{ m} \) (Fig. 3b). Light waves passing through the grating are received
by the second cylinder which acts as a pivoting telescope. The pivoting telescope can be adjusted to any angle to intercept diffracted rays. The intercepted
rays then enter a lens with a crosshair, for which the user can precisely record
the angle measurement. Measurements are recorded in degrees using a Vernier
scale which gives precision to the first decimal place (Fig. 3c). The second
is a computerized Ocean Optics Red Tide USB650 spectrometer which uses
LoggerPro software to display data (Fig. 4). The computerized spectrometer
uses connection to a fiber optic cable that is placed in front of the specimen.
The light source comprised of a discharge lamp housing unit which provided
voltage to the various specimen (Fig. 5a). The specimen included hydrogen,
helium, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide gas, and were contained in individual
glass tubes (Fig. 5b). Once the specimen were placed inside the discharge lamp
housing, they emitted light as electrons in the gas de-excite.
A handheld diffraction grating was used to qualitatively analyze the emission
spectra of the specimens (Fig. 6).
We used four indium phosphide quantum dots of various radii for analysis
of band gap energy and photon wavelength emission (Fig. 7a). LEDs of various
wavelengths (Fig. 7b) were used to excite electrons in the quantum dots.
</p>

<h3 class="major">Experiment 1</h3>

<p>
    Experiment 1 aimed to collect data for the emission spectrum of hydrogen using
the Griffin spectrometer. The room lights were switched off to keep environmental variables relating to electromagnetic radiation constant. This also allowed
our pupils to be dilated to best view spectral lines. The hydrogen specimen was
inserted inside the discharge housing unit, which was then placed adjacent to
the collimator entry slit of the spectrometer. The slit width was adjusted so that
we could accurately center the cross hairs on the light source. With the pivoting
telescope centered on the source, we recorded the angle of un-diffracted light
passing through the grating on the spectrometer. Then we rotated the pivoting
telescope and recorded the angles and color at which light was diffracted from
the grating.
</p>

<h3 class="major">Experiment 2</h3>

<p>
    Experiment 2 aimed to collect data for the emission spectrum of hydrogen using the Red Tide computerized spectrometer. The spectrometer was connected
via USB to a lab computer with LoggerPro software installed. LoggerPro settings were configured such that sampling time was 50 milliseconds, wavelength
smoothing set to zero, and results set to average from twenty samples. A fiber
optic cable was inserted into the spectrometer, and the other end placed in front
of the hydrogen light source using a standard mount. The intensity of the light
source was then plotted as a function of wavelength in LoggerPro.
</p>

<h3 class="major">Experiment 3</h3>

<p>
    In order to analyze the emission spectrum across a variety of specimens, the specimens were viewed and imaged through a handheld diffraction grating. First,
the hydrogen specimen was inserted into the discharge housing unit and was imaged with the diffraction grating. This was repeated for the helium, nitrogen,
and carbon dioxide specimen.
</p>

<h3 class="major">Experiment 4</h3>

<p>
    Using one wavelength at a time, the LED was shone under each quantum dot
vial. We recorded any effects the LED had on each vial, specifically if the vial
emitted any additional visible light. This process was done for the red, yellow,
green, and blue LEDs. The UV LED was shone under each vial, with the
fiber optic cable of the Red Tide computerized spectrometer placed next to it
to record the emission spectrum produced by the quantum dots. The radii of
the quantum dots in each vial was recorded along with its associated emission
spectrum.
</p>

<h3 class="major">Results</h3>

<p>
The emission diffraction angles for the hydrogen specimen were recorded for the
\( m=0, 1, 2 \) diffraction orders (Fig. 8). We defined the angle of diffracted
light as relative to \( m=0 \) un-diffracted light.
The order in which colors appear for each diffraction order remain the same.
In our experimental case, the violet emission line for \( m=2 \) was too dim to detect
with the naked eye. However, the aqua and red wavelengths for \( m=2 \) follow this
pattern. This is due to the diffraction maxima equation (Eq. 2). As \( \theta \) increases
from zero on the left hand side, the right hand side must increase in magnitude. Therefore, for \( m=1 \) the lower wavelength light will be seen first, and as
\( \theta \) increases, higher wavelengths of light are observed. Once \( \theta \) increases sufficiently, the diffraction order increases to two, and the wavelength downshifts.
The wavelength then increases again as the angle continues to increase.
Using Eq. 2, we can convert the angular measurements of diffraction into
the peak wavelengths of diffraction. We can analyze the spectrometer results by
plotting the inverse of the wavelength as a function of \( 1/n^2 \) where \( n\) is the initial
energy level prior to de-excitation of the electron in the hydrogen atom (Fig. 9).
Since visible light is caused by an electron where \( n_{\text{final}} =
2 \), Eq. 3 can be rearranged:

\[ \frac{1}{\lambda} = -R \frac{1}{n_{\text{final}}} + \frac{R}{4} \]

Therefore, the magnitude of the slope in Fig. 9 gives an experimental prediction for \( R \). Using a t-distribution of
the data, we can give a 95 percent confidence interval that \( R = 10784000±81000 \)
(calculation of this confidence interval is further explained in Appendix A).
The accepted value of \( R \) as shown below Eq. 3 is outside of the confidence
interval stated above. This means that there is likely an error in the experimental equipment or setup, which is likely due to the small dataset
size. Because of the limitations of the human eye, the Griffin spectrometer was
only able to pick up on three of the spectral lines of hydrogen. Additionally,
the Griffin spectrometer has a relatively low precision required for measuring
wavelengths to the nanometer scale. The angular measurement of the Griffin
was able to increase at an interval of 0.001745 radians, giving an error to the
wavelength measurement at roughly \(\pm\)1 nanometer.
</p>

<p>The Red Tide USB650 computerized spectrometer detected light intensity as
a function of wavelength for the emission of hydrogen (Fig. 10). By finding
the peaks of the plot, we could calculate the wavelengths of photons emitted
by the de-excitation of electrons in the hydrogen atom. Since we are only
concerned with the visible emission spectrum of hydrogen for which \( n_{\text{final}} = 2 \),
we disregarded peaks associated with wavelengths greater than 700nm which
are primarily due to the specimen containing some hydrogen gas. The hydrogen gas causes the small peaks noticeable in between large peaks due to oscillations
in the \( \text{H}_{2} \) bond.
We can analyze the spectrometer results in a similar fashion by plotting \( 1/ \lambda \) as a function of 
\( 1/n^2 \) (Fig. 11). Using
the magnitude of the slope, we found the experimental estimate \( R = 10960000 \pm 38000.\) The accepted value of \( R \) falls within this estimate, therefore
proving the validity of the experimental equipment and setup.
</p>

<p>
    The spectra of hydrogen, helium, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide were imaged via
a handheld diffraction grating (Fig. 12). Qualitatively,
we can observe that bonded sources have different emission spectra characteristics than atomic sources. The spectra of bonded sources have a more complete
range of emitted wavelengths in comparison to the atomic sources. We attribute
this to the higher number of electrons at varying energy levels in bonded sources
such as \(\text{CO}_2 \). After excitement these electrons have a chance to fall back into
various different energy levels which each give off specific wavelengths of light.
Additionally, the atoms in all molecules oscillate at some unique frequency due
to their bond. These atomic oscillations replicate the motion of a simple harmonic oscillator (SHO) at small displacements, and therefore, the electrons of
the individual atoms are confined to a SHO potential. In a SHO potential particles exhibit discrete energies corresponding to their quantum state \(n \) according
to

\[ \text{E}_{n} = (n+\frac{1}{2}) h \nu \]

where \( \nu \) is the oscillatory frequency of the potential. However, \( \text{E}_{n} \) is much smaller in magnitude in comparison to the energy released by an electron as it transitions to a lower energy
level. Therefore, the emitted photons due to electron de-excitement in a molecular source vary slightly depending on \( \text{E}_{n} \), which causes a more continuous or
”blurred” emission spectrum. Singular atoms do not oscillate, therefore we observe clear, distinct wavelengths for helium in Fig. 12. However, we also observe
that the emission lines for hydrogen and nitrogen appear blurred as if there were
some sort of oscillatory behavior. We hypothesize that the blurred spectra for
these two specimen are due to helium and nitrogen existing naturally as diatomic molecules. Therefore, there is likely some trace amount of hydrogen and
nitrogen gas in each of the sample tubes which provide the oscillatory behavior
we observe in the emission spectra.
</p>

<p>
    The emission spectra of each of the vials under the ultraviolet LED were recorded
via the Red Tide spectrometer. We plotted the wavelength of the emission of
each vial vs. the intensity (Figs. 13, 14, 15, and 16). It is important to note that
the intensity was not calibrated, so the actual value of the intensity is unitless.
However, we can still use this intensity to compare the wavelengths that result
in intensity peaks between quantum dot emission spectra.
Each emission spectrum plot contains three high intensity peaks, two medium
intensity peaks, and many small peaks. The ultraviolet LED wavelength should
range roughly between 100nm to 400nm, corresponding to the first medium peak in all four plots. The three high intensity peaks remain constant throughout all
four emission spectra. This was attributed to environmental factors in the experimental setup. Specifically, these high intensity peaks are most likely due
to the computer screen from which data was being displayed. Therefore, the
second medium peak must be due to the emitted photons of the quantum dot.
We confirm this by noticing that the second small peak varies in all the emission
spectrum plots. The very small peaks occur throughout the entire spectrum, so
this can be attributed to radiation noise from the environment.
</p>

<p>
    We can measure the peak emitted wavelengths of each quantum dot vial
using the emission spectra plots (Fig. 17). We then solve for the gap energy \( \text{E}_{\text{gap}} \)
and the effective mass of the electron \( \text{m} \) by plotting \( \frac{1}{\lambda} \) vs. \( \frac{1}{r^2} \) and calculating
the slope and the y-intercept (Fig. 18). By rearranging Eq. 4 we get:
 \[ \frac{1}{\lambda} = \frac{h}{8 \text{m} c^{2}} \frac{1}{r^2} + \frac{\text{E}_{\text{gap}}}{hc}\]

The slope leads to an estimate
of \( \text{m} ≈ 0.0612 \text{m}_{\text{e}} \) via Eq. 7. Similarly, the intercept of the plot leads to
an estimate of \( \text{E}_{\text{gap}} ≈ 1.265\text{eV} \). Using a t-distribution we
can put 95 percent confidence intervals such that \( \text{m} = (0.0612 \pm .012)\text{m}_{\text{e}} \) and
\( \text{E}_{\text{gap}} = 1.265\text{eV} \pm 0.15\text{eV} \). The accepted values for the effective mass of the electron
and the band gap energy of indium phosphide quantum dots are \( \text{m} = 0.065 \text{m}_{\text{e}} \)
and \( \text{E}_{\text{gap}} = 1.344\text{eV} \), respectively.
</p>

<h3 class="major">Conclusion</h3>

<p>
This study aimed to confirm accepted, yet important observations regarding
atomic spectroscopy. The study began with detecting the emission spectrum
of hydrogen using two methods. The first used a manual spectrometer with a
diffraction grating that separated peak wavelengths of the source. We found
that this method was fairly accurate but did not allow us to gather enough data
because of the limitations of the human eye. When plotting the inverse of the
peak wavelengths as a function of \( n \), we observed a linear relationship as predicted by theory, but the measured value of \( R \) did not agree with the accepted
value. This could be due to the small dataset size and the lack of precision in
angular measurements. The second used a computerized spectrometer, which
provided more data than the manual spectrometer. Under the same graphical analysis, we found an estimated value for \( R = 10960000 \pm 38000 \) which did
agree with the accepted value. We continued the study by qualitatively analyzing the differences in emission spectra between atomic and bonded sources.
We found that bonded sources exhibited more complex and complete spectra.
We attributed this to the larger number of electrons in various energy levels in
bonded atoms and the oscillatory effects of bonded atoms. Finally, the study
concluded with an analysis of quantum dots and their dependence on chemical
composition and dot radii in emitting various wavelengths of light. We found
that our measured emission spectrum for each quantum dot under an ultraviolet LED had wavelength peaks that varied with the dot radius. In graphical
analysis, we found that our data did agree with accepted values for the effective
mass of electron and the band gap energy.

    Calculating confidence intervals with small datasets requires a t-distribution
rather than a normal distribution. The calculation for the confidence interval
was given by the function \( polyparci \) implemented in MATLAB [4]. This function
uses the built-in MATLAB function \( polyfit \) to calculate the covariance matrix.
The function then calculates the cumulative t-distribution given a user-specified
