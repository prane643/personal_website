<p>
    Due to the lack of atmosphere on the Moon,
the lunar surface is constantly exposed to
solar wind irradiation, galactic cosmic
radiation, solar energetic particles, and
micrometeorite impacts. While these
processes are generally considered
destructive, some scientists believe that solar
wind exposure and micrometeorite impacts
significantly contribute to the formation and
movement of water on the lunar surface.\(^{1234}\)
Water, an essential resource for long-term
lunar exploration, has been confirmed to
exist on the Moon by orbital spacecraft.\(^5\)
However, the formation and precise location
of water within lunar material remain not
fully understood. It is believed that varying
quantities of \(\text{H}_2\), \(\text{H}_{2}\text{O}\), and/or \(\text{OH}\) form
within lunar material after exposure to solar
wind, which is comprised of high-energy
protons, electrons, and trace amounts of
heavy ions. In this process, the protons are
thought to penetrate and form bonds within
the oxygen-rich regolith.
Recently, scientists have identified
hydrogen-bearing species residing within
vesicles in lunar samples\(^6\) (Figure 1). These
vesicles have been shown to form
approximately 50 nanometers beneath the surface of
the lunar regolith. However, the presence of
\(\text{H}_{2}\text{O}\) within these vesicles has yet to be confirmed, and the physical processes
governing vesicle formation are not entirely
understood.

</p>
<p>
    In this study, we perform deuterium ion
    irradiation on silicon dioxide, a lunar-relevant
    material, to recreate subsurface
    vesicles that may contain deuterium-bearing
    species. We examine the ion-induced
    damage to these materials to calibrate the
    deuterium ion source exposure parameters
    necessary for proper vesicle formation. Our
    ultimate goal is to use the calibrated
    deuterium ion source to irradiate Apollo 17 sample 75035.232 and
    recreate vesicles.</p>

<h3 class="major">Methods</h3>

<p>
    To recreate the conditions of solar wind
    bombardment, we used a deuterium ion source with variable flux and
    exposure time (Figure 2). The energy of the
    deuterium ions is set constant at 2 keV.
    Additionally, an electron beam was
    employed to prevent charging during the
    irradiation of the silicon dioxide samples. The fluence
    (ions/cm²) of the deuterium source was
    adjusted by varying the flux and exposure
    time, facilitating vesicle formation.

</p>

<p>During irradiation, we used samples of silicon dioxide
    with a 300 nanometer oxide layer on a silicon wafer.
    The samples were exposed to various
    fluences, and the resulting surface damage
    was analyzed using atomic force microscopy
    (AFM) with a Bruker Dimension Icon.
    Quantitative analysis of blister coverage in
    silicon dioxide was performed using the StarDist\(^7\)
    package, which utilizes a neural network
    pretrained on fluorescent microscopy images
    of cells. This network effectively computes
    instance segmentation maps of the
    deuterium blisters using a star-convex
    polygon representation.</p>

<h3 class="major">Results</h3>

<p>
    The AFM data of exposed silicon dioxide reveal the creation of
blisters on the surface that we believe
contain deuterium species. However, at
fluences above \(2.1 \times 10^{19}\) \(\text{cm}^{-2}\), the blisters
are observed to have burst, resulting in deep cavities on the surface (Figure 3).

    <center>Figure 3. Atomic force microscopy at various fluences. Data indicates the presence of deuterium
        blisters at select fluences. At high fluence, the blisters burst indicating overexposure.</center>
</figcaption>
</p>

<p>Segmentation results using StarDist on an
    AFM image of exposed silicon dioxide provide spatial
    coordinate data for each blister, allowing for
    the calculation of metrics such as total
    blister percentage, average blister size, and
    blister size deviation (Figure 4).

            blisters in silicon dioxide using StarDist.</center>

    This
    analysis technique indicates a positive
    correlation between fluence and blistering
    percentage, as shown in the segmentation of
    samples with multiple fluences (Figure 5).

</p>

<h3 class="major">Discussion</h3>

<p>
    In addition to using StarDist, I
experimented with another computational
approach for segmenting blisters and
extracting coordinate data. This method
involved a convolutional neural network
(CNN) with a modified U-net\(^8\) architecture
to perform semantic segmentation. The
results produced a binary mask that
classified each pixel in the AFM images as
either “blister” or “not-blister.” However,
we encountered two significant problems
with this method.
</p>

<p>
    First, while semantic segmentation
effectively classifies pixels into categories, it
does not provide a way to extract coordinate
data when blisters overlap. Since deuterium
blisters begin to overlap at higher fluences
(Figure 3), this limitation becomes critical
when extracting metrics such as average
blister size. Second, the quantity of AFM
image data collected was insufficient to train
an accurate segmentation algorithm.
Although data augmentation can increase
dataset sizes, our collected AFM image data
was still inadequate. StarDist addresses both
issues by using star-convex polygons to
represent blisters and leveraging a pretrained
neural network. From this, we can accurately extract the average size and
density of blisters.
</p>

<p>
    The relationship between ion fluence and
blister coverage shown in Figure 5 indicates
that a deuterium fluence of less than \(10^{18}\)
\(\text{cm}^{-2}\) provides sufficient ion exposure to
promote the formation of spatially separated
deuterium blisters on the surface without
overexposure. We believe these spatially
separated deuterium surface blisters indicate
the formation of spatially separated
subsurface vesicles, as shown in Figure 1.
</p>

<p>
    Our future work includes performing
irradiation with the calibrated fluence on
anorthite, a lunar-relevant
mineral that is more complex than silicon dioxide. We will use focused ion
beam (FIB) lift-outs and scanning
transmission electron microscopy (STEM)
to analyze subsurface vesicle formation in
anorthite. Upon confirmation of vesicle
formation in anorthite, we will irradiate
lunar sample 75035.232 with the same
fluence, perform FIB lift-outs and STEM,
and analyze any vesicles present.
Additionally, we will use nano-FTIR\(^9\) to
identify chemical species that may be trapped in vesicles. If
\(\text{D}_{2}\text{}\) is found within vesicles in the lunar
sample, it would provide concrete evidence
that solar wind exposure can facilitate the
production of water on the Moon.
