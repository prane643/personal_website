										<h3 class="major">Summary</h3>
										<p>In my undergraduate career I have taken coursework at Haverford College, Bryn Mawr College, University of Pennsylvania, and University of Maryland. Below are the coursework I have taken in computer science, physics, engineering, and mathematics. Additionally, my unofficial transcript from Haverford College as of Summer 2024 can be found <a href="files/transcipt.pdf" download="Pranav_transcript.pdf" style="color: lightblue; text-decoration: underline;">here</a>.</p>

										<h3 class="major">Baseball</h3>

										<p><span class="image left"><img src="projects/images/baseball1.JPG" alt="" /></span>I started playing baseball when I was three years old alongside my older brother, and I quickly grew to love the game. Some of my fondest childhood memories were made on a dirt and grass field, and as I look back, I can't help but deeply appreciate those moments and the people, especially my parents, who made them possible. Baseball has taught me lessons that have influenced every aspect of my life. Striving to be the best player I could became a central focus, instilling in me dedication, perseverance, and discipline. I attended St. John's College High School in Washington, D.C., a baseball powerhouse consistently ranked among the top 20 high school programs in the nation. The 6 AM workouts, followed by a full day of school and practice until 6 PM, pushed my discipline and organization to their highest levels. My four years of high school baseball were a testament to my ability to excel both academically, achieving a 4.5 GPA, and athletically, while also creating countless memories that I will cherish for a lifetime. </p>
										<p><span class="image right"><img src="projects/images/baseball2.JPG" alt="" /></span>With baseball being such an important part of my life, I decided to continue playing in college. I committed to Haverford College to receive an excellent education while competing in Division 3 baseball. The traits I acquired during high school were once again crucial to my success on the field, in the classroom, and in my research endeavors. Over the past three years of playing college baseball, I have learned the importance of fostering strong teamwork within our team. While developing my own skills is important for my performance, I recognize that achieving our goal of winning games requires communication and trust within our team, and in general looking out for one another. The pictures below were taken during conference games, and the short clip shows me hitting a three-run home run that helped our team secure a spot in the playoffs. </p>

										I've found great satisfaction in teaching what I've learned to younger players. For the past three years, I have coached three teams of 9-12 year olds at my local Little Leagueâ€”the same organization I was a part of as a kid. Watching these kids develop over the course of a season has been both rewarding and enjoyable. Some of my favorite memories include winning our Little League state tournament and advancing to the regional tournament, which was televised on ESPN+.
